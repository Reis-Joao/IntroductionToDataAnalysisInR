# IntroductionToDataAnalysisInR

This is the repository for my data analysis during the course "Introduction to Data Analysis in R - Winter Term 2022/2023", of Professor Marc Kaufmann. In here you can access all data, code and documents of the analysis.

In my data report I intend to work with the dataset on Covid-19 (coronavirus) by "Our World in Data" The authors (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) collected data on 207 countries, and every country information is updated daily. According to the website, “Our World in Data is a project of the Global Change Data Lab, a non-profit organization based in the United Kingdom” whose goal is to make “data and research on the world's largest problems understandable and accessible”, and the Covid-19 dataset fits in this description. All visualizations, data, and code produced by Our World in Data are completely open access, giving a powerful source for research and data analysis. It is also incredible useful the fact that through their website it is possible to visualize every bit of data with an interactive data explorer.

The current database can be accessed in "https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data", with a full description/sources of the variables in "https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv".
